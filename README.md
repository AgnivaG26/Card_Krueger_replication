## 1. Project Overview

This repository contains a complete replication of the seminal 1994 study by David Card and Alan B. Krueger, **"Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania"** (AER).

The analysis exploits the natural experiment created by New Jersey's minimum wage increase from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour in April 1992, using neighboring Pennsylvania as a control group. This project reproduces the paper's key tables and figures using STATA code executed within an R Markdown document, demonstrating a workflow that combines the strengths of both platforms for reproducible research.

The final, fully-rendered HTML report, including all tables and analysis, is published on RPubs and can be viewed here:

## 3. Research Question & Methodology

The study addresses a classic question in labor economics: **Do minimum wage increases reduce employment?**

To answer this, the authors employ a **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** research design. The methodology compares the change in employment in New Jersey's fast-food restaurants before and after the wage hike to the change in employment over the same period in Pennsylvania, where the minimum wage did not change. The core DiD regression specification is:

$$
\Delta E_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 T_{i} + \mathbf{X_{i}'}\gamma + \epsilon_i
$$

Where $\Delta E_{i}$ is the change in employment at store $i$, $T_{i}$ is a treatment indicator (equal to 1 for stores in New Jersey), and $\mathbf{X_{i}'}$ is a vector of control variables. The coefficient of interest, $\beta_1$, captures the causal effect of the minimum wage increase.

## 4. Repository Contents

This repository contains all files in the root directory to ensure compatibility with the STATA scripts.

* **Data Files**
    * `public.dat`: The original, raw survey data from Card and Krueger (1994).
    * `njmin.dct`: The STATA dictionary file created to read and parse `public.dat`.
    * `njmin_labeled.dta`: The processed and labeled STATA dataset generated by the script.

* **Code Files**
    * `Card_Krueger.Rmd`: The main R Markdown file containing all code, analysis, and text for the final report.
    * `Card_Krueger.do`: The standalone STATA do-file containing all the analysis commands.

* **Generated Output**
    * `table1.tex`, `table2.tex`, `table3.tex`, `regression_table.tex`: LaTeX files for the tables, generated by the STATA code.
    * `Feb_1992.jpg`, `Nov_1992.jpg`: The wage distribution plots generated by the STATA code.

## 5. How to Replicate

To replicate this analysis on your own machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Ensure you have **R**, **RStudio**, and **STATA** (version 17 or compatible) installed on your system.

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AgnivaG26/Card_Krueger_replication.git
    cd Card_Krueger_replication
    ```

3.  **Install R Packages:**
    Open RStudio and run the following command to install the necessary R package.
    ```r
    install.packages("Statamarkdown")
    ```

4.  **IMPORTANT: Configure STATA Path:**
    Open the `Card_Krueger.Rmd` file. In the first code chunk (the `setup` chunk), you **must** edit the following line to point to the location of your STATA executable file:
    ```r
    # EDIT THIS LINE to match your STATA installation path
    stataexe <- "D:/STATA17/StataMP-64.exe"
    ```

5.  **Run the Analysis:**
    With the STATA path correctly configured, click the **"Knit"** button in RStudio. This will execute all the STATA and R code in the `.Rmd` file and generate a self-contained HTML report with all the tables, plots, and analysis.

## 6. Tools and Packages Used

* **Primary Software:** STATA, R, RStudio
* **Key R Packages:**
    * `Statamarkdown`: To execute STATA code within R Markdown.
    * `rmdformats`: For the final HTML report theme.
    * `dplyr`, `haven`, `kableExtra`: For supplementary analysis and tables in R.
